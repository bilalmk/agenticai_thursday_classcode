# Assignment : **Build a Smart Customer Support Bot using OpenAI Agent SDK**

## Objective
Create a customer support bot using OpenAI's Agent SDK that can handle basic FAQs, fetch order statuses, and escalate to a human agent when necessary. The bot should also implement guardrails to ensure positive interactions and showcase advanced features of the SDK.

## Requirements
You will build a bot that can assist customers with common queries and order tracking. The bot should be able to handle simple requests autonomously, use function tools to fetch data, and escalate to a human agent for complex queries or negative sentiment.

* **Answer basic product FAQs**
* **Fetch order status using a simulated API (function tool)**
* **Escalate to a human agent if the query is complex or sentiment is negative (handoff)**
* **Enforce a simple guardrail: block or rephrase negative/offensive user input**
* **Showcase usage of model\_settings (tool\_choice, metadata, etc.)**
* **Showcase advanced use of @function\_tool decorator, including is\_enabled and error\_function**

### **Breakdown of Required Elements**

#### 1. **Create Two Agents**

* **BotAgent**: Handles FAQs, order lookup (function tools).
* **HumanAgent**: For escalation (handoff).

#### 2. **Implement Function Tools**

* `@function_tool`: `get_order_status(order_id)`: Simulates fetching order status.

  * Use `is_enabled` to toggle the tool (e.g., only enabled for "order" queries).
  * Use `error_function` to return a friendly error if order\_id not found.

#### 3. **Guardrails**

* Use `@guardrail` to check for offensive or negative language. If detected, return a warning or rephrase the response.

#### 4. **Agent Handoff**

* If the bot detects a query it canâ€™t handle or sentiment is negative, **handoff** to the HumanAgent.

#### 5. **ModelSettings Usage**

* Set `tool_choice="auto"` or `"required"` and pass custom `metadata` (e.g., store customer ID).
* Experiment with the effect of tool\_choice and metadata in responses.

#### 6. **Bonus: Logging**

* Log all tool invocations and handoffs for traceability.

### **What To Submit**

* Your full source code (with improvements or customizations)
* **Comments** on where you used: tool call, handoff, guardrail, ModelSettings options, function\_tool decorators.
* Screenshots or logs showing all scenarios working.
